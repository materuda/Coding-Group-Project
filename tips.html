          Throwing a sustainable and socially conscious wedding</h1>

        </header>

        <br>
        <p> Many of us spend thousands of dollars and many months planning what ends up being one of the most amazing days of our lives. Yet, those of us who plan weddings are missing a chance to make it not only a special day in lives of those getting married, but also something special for others--in particular those in need. While you may not have that much money to donate to charitable causes on a regular basis, making decisions to plan your socially conscious wedding way is a great start to the rest of your life. Knowing that each choice you make as a couple strengthens communities near and far allows you to be a part of positive change all over the world!

            <ul class="list-unstyled">
              <li class='important'>Engage organisations that support a good cause</li>
              <li>The food, the flowers, the rings, the clothes--when you're planning a wedding, there are a lot of investments being made. Besides supporting local vendors, try supporting those that support a good cause themselves. For example, you can hire <a href="directory.html">social enterprises</a> to help with your wedding needs - this helps in providing jobs for the disadvantaged, too. Additionally, you can also grab your entourage and have a volunteer day! Be it in place for your bridal shower or bachelorette party, you can turn your pre-wedding events into chances to help others.</li>
              <br>
              <li class='important'>Reduce, reuse, and recycle</li>
              <li>Have a look around your house and check out what you can recycle, and try a little D.I.Y. You can use old beer or wine bottles as flower vases, and even use scratch paper to make paper flowers. You can also ask family and friends for old material they aren't using (such as old clothes or linens) and consider recycling them as either bridesmaid dresses or table runners. There is no limit when it comes to recycling--all you have to do is be creative! And while you're at it recycle all reusable products from your wedding!</li>
              <br>
              <li class='important'>Donate what's left</li>
              <li>There will be a lot of things that will be left over after the celebration: flowers, food, possibly favours other guests forgot to get, and more. Talk to your coordinator and come up with a plan to pack everything that's left to be delivered to people who will be able to make the most out of it. You can send the flowers to a hospital or an elderly home, you can send the food to a charity, or even to the staff who haven't had a chance to eat yet.</li>

          <div id='dress' class='tips'>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
              <li class='important'>Ethically sourced wedding dresses</li>
              <li>It is no secret that the wedding dress industry is chalk full of stunning gowns that will please most any bride. The choices are endless. But at what expense, or whose? Thanks to fast fashion there are distributors and retailers with the resources to create bridal gowns that keep up with the trends of every season, but the manufacturing morals are an ugly sight to behold. To avoid sewing into a designer who relies on unsafe working environments and paying deplorable wages to their employees, make the choice to select your wedding dress from a mindful designer whose vision is to design gorgeous gowns while doing their part to positively impact the world.</li>
              <br>
              <li class='important'>Rent or buy a secondhand dress</li>
              <li>If fair trade dresses are not what you're looking for (or in your price range), there are many boutiques that specialize in samples and "worn once" dresses. Brides wear their dress once so secondhand is the perfect way to reuse something that is only meant to be used once making it an alternative for the consciously eco-friendly brides-to-be. Brides can also consider renting your gown instead of buying, and you'll save money and conserve resources at the same time. Alternatively, the bride can also wear mom's old dress for a green and sentimental solution! These keep a lot of unnecessary waste out of landfills. For additional impact, let your bridesmaids similarly rent their dresses or to wear dresses they already own.</li>
              <br>
              <li class='important'>Donate your dress</li>
              <li>Unless you are thinking of passing your wedding gown to your children, consider donating your wedding dress to charity shops such as <a href="https://www.oxfam.org.uk/shop/bridal">Oxfam</a>. Alternatively, <a href="https://www.bridesdogood.com">Brides Do Good</a> is a social enterprise that sells luxury pre-loved and sample designer wedding gowns to eradicate child marriage. Two-thirds of their proceeds are used to fund their charity programmes run by Plan International UK and Too Young to Wed.</li>

          <div id='food' class='tips'>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
              <li class='important'>Eat locally grown produce or find dish alternatives</li>
              <li>Organic foods are great but might be out of the price range for some wedding; there are always other ways to not add environmental insult to injury. Select caterers and vendors that work with local farms to source their food (same for booze). Think about dish alternatives, lamb and beef have the worst footprints so chicken might be your best option. Cheese also has a large footprint because it comes from cows, so perhaps focus on a veggie platter at cocktail hour. And also try to stick to fruits and vegetables that are local and in season. If you have a winter wedding, root vegetables are most appropriate, if you live inland far from the sea focus on serving freshwater fish instead. Hiring the right vendor that is willing to work with you to create a fabulous menu both in taste and environmentalism is key.</li>
              <br>
              <li class='important'>Reduce food wastage and donate remaining food</li>
              <li>For your wedding, consider reducing the number of dishes - don't worry about appearing stingy. I'm sure your guests will take quality over quantity, anyway. Couples can also make sure that the leftover food is donated or at the very least composted. Choose a caterer that will honor your decision to have leftover food donated to local halfway houses or homeless shelters--many non-profits will gratefully accept food donations from your events.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div id='flowers' class='tips'>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
              <li class='important'>Order seasonal and local flowers</li>
              <li>If flowers are a must, order ones that are in season and local. Potted plants for centerpieces, especially perennials, can be replanted and enjoyed for many seasons. Also check out the farmer's markets in your area. Many sell locally produced seasonal flowers. If they don't, it's worth a phone call anyway. It's likely that they know all the organic farms in the area, and may be able to refer you to a farmer who specializes in flowers.</li>
              <br>
              <li class='important'>Donate wedding day blooms</li>
              <li>One of the biggest wastage of weddings are flowers. Do like the recently minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex did for their nuptials, and put a smile on others' faces with the blooms from your celebration. Consider donating your florals to a hospital, local assisted living center, or nursing home; many of these centers are thrilled to accept your donations and share them with their residents to brighten their day.</li>
